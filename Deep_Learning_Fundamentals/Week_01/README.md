# WEEK 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

##### What is Machine Learning?

>> Using **Data** to uncover **unknown** Underlying process

##### Components of Machine Learning

--- Metaphor --> Problem statement or The Issue that the Model works on

--- Decision --> The Outcomes that are expected from the ML model

--- Formulation -->

1. inputs (features) 
2. outputs (label)
3. underlying process (unknown)(blackbox process): f: X->Y
4. Data : (Historic Data) : set of data {x_i,y_i} where i is from 1 to N
5. Decision function g : X ->y such that g is equivalent to f(the actual function)

--> for a new x' predict y' = g(x')
