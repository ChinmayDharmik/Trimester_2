Introduction to Machine Learning

-- components of machine learning 
--- formulation 
>> inputs (features) 
>> outputs (label)
>> underlying process (unknown)(blackbox process): f: X->Y
>> Data : (Historic Data) : set of data {x_i,y_i} where i is from 1 to N
>> Decision function g : X ->y such that g is equivalent to f(the actual function)
>> for a new x' predict y' = g(x')
